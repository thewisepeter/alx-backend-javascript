**ES6 Promises**

Delving deepeer into the Backend with JavaScript

***Promises***
A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.

***Asynchronous Operations***
Asynchronous

An "asynchronous" operation refers to a type of operation in a program or script that doesn't block the execution of the entire program while waiting for the operation to complete. In other words, asynchronous operations allow the program to continue running other tasks while waiting for a particular operation to finish.
