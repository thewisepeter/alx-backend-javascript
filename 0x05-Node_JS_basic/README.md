# Node.js Basics

## Introduction

This repository serves as a beginner's guide to Node.js, covering fundamental concepts and practical examples to get you started with server-side JavaScript development.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it ideal for building scalable network applications.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring Node.js, ensure you have it installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

Once installed, you can check the version of Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Basics Covered

1. **Hello World**: Start with a simple "Hello World" example to verify your Node.js installation.
2. **Modules**: Understand Node.js modules and how to create, import, and use them in your applications.
3. **File System**: Learn how to work with the file system module to read, write, and manipulate files.
4. **HTTP Module**: Explore the HTTP module to create a basic HTTP server and handle HTTP requests.
5. **Asynchronous Programming**: Grasp the concept of asynchronous programming in Node.js using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
6. **npm**: Discover the Node Package Manager (npm) and how to manage dependencies for your Node.js projects.

## Examples

In the directory, you'll find practical examples corresponding to each topic covered in the Basics section. Each example includes a README.md file with instructions on how to run the code.
